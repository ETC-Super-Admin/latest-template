# E-commerce Project Enhancement Requirements (v3)

This document outlines the necessary implementations to tailor the hero-template into a production-grade, modern **e-commerce** application.

## 1. üèõÔ∏è E-commerce Architecture

Adopt a scalable, feature-based architecture centered around e-commerce domains.

- **Priority:** High
- **Implementation:**
  - **Refactor to Feature-Based Structure:** Following the model in `template-structure.md`, create a `src/features` directory. Key initial features to build out are:
    - `features/products`: For product display, filtering, and search.
    - `features/cart`: For all shopping cart logic.
    - `features/checkout`: For the order placement process.
    - `features/authentication`: For user accounts and profiles.
  - **Comprehensive Data Models:**
    - Expand `src/types` or move to `src/features/[feature]/types.ts` to define a full suite of e-commerce interfaces: `Product`, `ProductVariant`, `Category`, `Cart`, `CartItem`, `Order`, `Address`, and `User`.
  - **API Layer Abstraction:**
    - Create a central API client in `src/lib/api.ts` to handle base URL configuration, headers, and consistent error handling for all backend communication.

## 2. ‚ú® Core E-commerce Features

Implement the foundational features that define an e-commerce experience.

- **Priority:** High
- **Implementation:**
  - **State Management for Cart:**
    - Use **Zustand** to manage the shopping cart state. Create a store in `src/features/cart/store.ts`.
    - The store should handle actions like `addItem`, `removeItem`, `updateItemQuantity`, and `clearCart`.
    - This state should be client-side and accessible by any component (e.g., `ProductCard`, `Navbar`'s cart icon).
  - **Server State for Products & Users:**
    - Use **TanStack Query** for all server data: fetching products, categories, user profiles, and order history.
  - **Authentication:**
    - Integrate **NextAuth.js** or **Clerk** to manage user accounts. This is essential for saving carts, order history, and addresses.
  - **Payment Gateway Integration:**
    - Plan for payment processing by integrating a library like **`@stripe/react-stripe-js`**.
    - Create a placeholder `features/checkout/services.ts` to encapsulate payment intent creation and order submission logic.

## 3. üß™ Testing Strategy

A robust testing suite focused on critical e-commerce user flows.

- **Priority:** High
- **Implementation:**
  - **Unit/Integration Testing:**
    - Use **Vitest** and **React Testing Library** to test:
      - Utility functions (price formatting, etc.).
      - Individual components (`PriceDisplay`, `ProductCard`).
      - State logic in the Zustand cart store.
  - **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    - Use **Playwright** to create tests for the most critical user journeys:
      1.  **Product Discovery:** Searching for a product and filtering results.
      2.  **Add to Cart:** Adding an item to the cart from a PDP.
      3.  **Full Checkout Flow:** Completing a purchase as both a guest and a logged-in user.

## 4. ‚öôÔ∏è Code Quality & DX

Maintain a high-quality, consistent codebase as the application scales.

- **Priority:** High
- **Implementation:**
  - **Git Hooks:** Configure **Husky** and **lint-staged** to auto-format and lint code on pre-commit.
  - **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up **GitHub Actions** to run all checks (type checking, linting, testing, building) on every pull request to ensure the main branch remains stable.

---

## 5. üìö Documentation & Component Development

- **Priority:** Medium
- **Implementation:**
  - **Storybook for E-commerce Components:**
    - Add Storybook to develop and document UI components in isolation.
    - Create stories for core e-commerce components like `ProductCard`, `PriceDisplay`, and `CartItem` to ensure they are reusable and visually consistent.
  - **Update `README.md`:**
    - Document the e-commerce architecture, setup instructions, and how to run all testing and development scripts.
